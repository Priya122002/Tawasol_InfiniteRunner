This project is a fast-paced endless runner developed in Unity for Android. The player automatically moves forward through a neon-themed environment, requiring quick reactions and precise control as the game speed gradually increases to raise the overall challenge.

The core gameplay features lane-based left and right movement, jumping to avoid obstacles, collecting glowing orbs to increase score, and a limited life system. The project is built using Unity URP with custom glow shaders and bloom effects, and is optimized for mobile performance and reduced build size.
